# ludusbackup

This is a script to take backups of everyone's class schemas for Ludusweb. I
made this script, because it went down from time to time which caused confusion
for the entire school. Nobody knew where they were supposed to be, or what
course they were supposed to have.

Because Ludusweb's HTML is hideous, it takes screenshots of every class' schema
and their homework for each class, sanely named. Thus the directory generated by
this script can be served with any webserver.
